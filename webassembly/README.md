This is the engine used by SwiftLaTeX. It was based on XeTeX and patched to output HTMLs instead of PDFs. 

Also, it is using an in-built SyncTeX-like plugin. It maps each character in HTMLs to its source code location (including line and column). 
Conventional SyncTeX only allows for line-level accuracy.
